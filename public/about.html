  I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering on May 2019 at Lorma Colleges, Carlatan Campus, City of San Fernando,
  La Union 2500. I was a Dean's Lister from my first year until the last year of my study. After graduation, I have decided to take on
  a short vacation to unwind and relieve the stress from my college life for about 6 months. During my vacation, I keep on learning new things
  at home while doing some helping in my family and also in our community. The next year 2020, I have decided to start up my employment
  and began to apply on some companies but I did not get any luck. Unfortunately, the pandemic strike the Philippines and I was stunned and got scared
  to go in Manila to look for a job. So, our family decided to start a business in our barangay which is a Milktea Shop and a small restaurant.
  I helped on building and improving our establishment as well as managing the business for about 2 years up until this year.

  Now, I want to move on to the next level and decided to pursue my dream profession which is a Web Developer. I started to take up a boothcamp
  at Udemy in order to freshen up my knowledge on programming as well as taking it to advanced level. I will continue to learn and improve my skill on programming
  so that I can achieve my goals and continue to grow for a better future.
